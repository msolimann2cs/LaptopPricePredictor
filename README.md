# Laptop Price Predictor

## Overview

The Laptop Price Predictor is a Python-based machine learning project that aims to predict laptop prices based on various features and specifications. This project involves a thorough data analysis and modeling pipeline, from data preprocessing to building a stacked ensemble model for accurate predictions.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Raw laptop data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and outliers are addressed to ensure high-quality data for analysis.

- **Data Analysis:** In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the relationships between different laptop features and their impact on prices.

- **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features are selected, and new features are engineered to enhance the predictive power of the models.

- **Model Selection:** Various machine learning models are evaluated, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to determine the best-performing models.

- **Stacked Model:** A stacked ensemble model is constructed, combining the strengths of multiple base models to improve predictive accuracy.

- **Testing and Evaluation:** The developed model is thoroughly tested using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) to assess its performance.
